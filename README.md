Go port of [yoeo/guesslang](https://github.com/yoeo/guesslang). Detects programming language of source code using a deep learning model.

## Setup

### Dependencies

Requires [`libtensorflow`](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/lang_c) C API.

On macOS, it can be installed with homebrew:

```
brew install libtensorflow
```

Alternatively, for Linux-based systems:

```
script/install-libtensorflow
```

### Install

```
go get github.com/robherley/guesslang-go
```

See example usage in [`examples/main.go`](/example/main.go)

## Caveats

To work around some of the limitations of the Go TensorFlow bindings (and the wrapper library)[^1], the [SavedModel](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/saved_model) is embeded in the binary and
when a [`Guesser`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/robherley/guesslang-go/pkg/guesser#Guesser) is initialized, it temporarily writes the model to a directory (and removes it after).

So, in order to use this package, you must at least have a writeable temporary directory that aligns with Go's [`os.TempDir()`](https://pkg.go.dev/os@go1.20.3#TempDir).
